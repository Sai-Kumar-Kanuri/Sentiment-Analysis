# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Dataset
Natural Language Processing

This is a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Sentiment Analysis in which we will try and classify a movie review as either positive or negative.

## Sentiment Analysis

[Opinion mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) (sometimes known as sentiment analysis or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).

# Sentiment Classification - of IMDb User Reviews - using LSTM
An end-to-end toolkit on building a movie review sentiment classification LSTM model in Keras Deep Learning and the deploying model h5 file on local machine using Flask. Model is trained on IMDb Movie reviews [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

As part of model training, we have trained three separate nodels, namely: Simple Neural Net, CNN and LSTM; and concluded with reasoning as to why LSTMs are well suited to handle (sequential) text data.

## How the model works!
